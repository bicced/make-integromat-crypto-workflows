Before enabling any workflow with funds or production credentials:

- Confirm node parameters and environment variables are set correctly
- Validate addresses, chain IDs, token decimals, and slippage settings
- Add timeouts and bounded retries where requests may fail
- Log critical steps and verify success conditions, not just request completion
- Start with testnets or dust amounts; progressively increase only after review
- Ensure your jurisdiction permits the actions you automate
